# Neural Network: LSTM.
# 

# Inputs are:
# IMU X, Y angles (2) ( 0 - 1, 0.5, 0.5 is flat level )
# CurrentAngles (8) ( 0 - 1, from 20 to 160 degrees, 0 being knees all straight up in the air, flipped for backwards motors )
# Resistances (8) ( 0 - 1, amount of resistance each motor is currently experiencing )
# MotorSpeeds (8) ( 0 - 1, current motor speeds from calculated from PID loop from output params )
# Sin(t) (1) ( 0 - 1, sin of t, where t is increasing with time )
# Cos(t) (1) ( 0 - 1, cos of t, where t is increasing with time )

# Outputs are:
# TargetAngles (8) ( 0 - 1, from 20 to 160 degrees. Flipped for every backwards motor, so 0 is always up. )
# P_rate (8) (0 - 1, from off to max_p_rate) (add later, fix to resonable default to start with)

# How it works
# Robot starts standing, all legs almost knees sraight up.
# CurrentAngles = [ 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 ]

# 1. Train the network to stay like that.
# Loss function = difference of targetAngles to [ 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 ]
